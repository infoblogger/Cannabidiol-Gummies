<p style="text-align: justify;">In this review, I&rsquo;ll be reviewing a set of 3 JustCBD products. These include JustCBD Coconut CBD Oil Tincture, CBD Ultra Relief Pain Cream, and CBD Signature Vape Cartridge (Sour Diesel). As you can see, JustCBD has a wide range of CBD applications, and quite frankly, all of their products have a good standing in the current US market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the brand&rsquo;s dedication towards reaping the benefits of CBD, their sales team sent out a JustCBD box with three products for an honest review. Talking about an honest review, when I opened up the box and saw three different CBD based products, I was in awe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the fact that JustCBD&rsquo;s team is conducting ongoing researches for the various uses of CBD and implementing it in different products is an excellent example of the company&rsquo;s dedication towards the betterment of our lives. I&rsquo;ve had past experiences with the brand, and ever since I switched to JustCBD, I did not have to look for any other alternatives. Before I get into the review of these products, I&rsquo;d like to give the company its due acknowledgment. Here&rsquo;s a little something about the company, JustCBD.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">About JustCBD</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Showing the world the true capabilities of CBD became the basis for the formation of JustCBD in 2017. As you can tell from the name, JustCBD is, in fact, just about CBD. Judging from the list of products by JustCBD, it has introduced us to the different applications of CBD. It has a wide range of products from ultra-relief pain creams to vegan gummies, tropicals, bath bombs, isolates, edibles, and many more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JustCBD is primarily based in Florida, USA. Having said that, JustCBD can ship its products nationwide. The fact that CBD products are often unmonitored, and there are no regulations for quality assurance, CBD users often end up in a dilemma when it comes to the quality of the products they&rsquo;re using. To address this, JustCBD thoroughly conducts different tests on its CBD products. Furthermore, they also made the results available for public use, which, quite frankly is a bold step. The availability of results on the internet assures that the claims of using 99.99% pure cannabidiol (CBD) in its products are, in fact, valid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike other brands that get their low-CBD fiber from foreign countries due to the costs, all of JustCBD products are sourced from 100% the US grown industrial hemp. In addition, when it comes to the packaging and overall quality of the JustCBD products, there&rsquo;s no better competitor in my point of view and trust me on this since I&rsquo;ve reviewed numerous CBD brands. If you&rsquo;re a frequent user of CBD products, you might have noticed that the tags/labels on CBD products often come off. However, with JustCBD, you won&rsquo;t have to face that problem anymore. If you&rsquo;ve read this much, I&rsquo;m sure you can guess that the review is looking quite good for the products that I received.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For its amazing performance in the CBD market, it has been featured in various publications including Los Angeles Confidential, Main Line Today, and Ministry of Hemp.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">An Honest Review of the JustCBD Coconut Oil CBD Tincture</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD induced in coconut oil is one of the fastest ways to experience the effects of CBD. Although I didn&rsquo;t actually believe the above statement at first, I was forced to believe this after using the JustCBD coconut oil tincture. I was amazed to see the effects of using the coconut oil CBD tincture, considering the almost instant relief from stress after a busy day at a family wedding. The primary ingredients of JustCBD coconut oil CBD tincture include Medium-chain triglyceride oil, water, and Cannabidiol (CBD) with a slight touch of THC. Although there is THC in the ingredients, it is under the legally recommended limit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are over 7 different sizes available for you to choose from. These include 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 550 mg, 1000 mg, 1500 mg, 3000 mg, and 5000 mg of CBD per container. From my experience with the oil CBD tincture, I can tell that this is the easiest way to consume CBD. Its bottle comes in a space-friendly design with a pre-designed eyedropper that allows you to consume this oil tincture right under your tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from using it under your tongue, you can also use this in your food, which is a great advantage if you&rsquo;re not a fan of using it under your tongue. After experiencing the immediate effects of CBD, I have to admit, the coconut oil CBD tincture by JustCBD is, hands down, my personal favorite now.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">An Honest Review of the JustCBD CBD Infused Pain Cream</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like every JustCBD product is made from 99.99% pure CBD, this CBD infused pain cream is also made with the purest hemp extract CBD. Weddings can be tiring, and even after having a good night&rsquo;s sleep, I still had pain in my arms. This was when I came across the thought of finally trying out the JustCBD CBD Infused Pain Cream.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Featuring 100 mg of pure CBD, it shipped in a 2 oz container. I applied it directly on my arm since I was a bit skeptical of the effects. Within a few minutes, I noticed the results and was blown away by seeing how effective it was. I ended up using it on both of my arms, and honestly, with the passage of time, my pain was no longer there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary ingredients used in JustCBD CBD Infused pain cream include organic aloe, leaf juice, organic coconut oil, glycerin, phenoxyethanol, organic hemp seed oil, rose flower water, organic rosemary leaf extract, stearic acid, emulsifying wax, witch hazel water, vitamin e, sunflower seed oil, organic neem seed oil, organic alcohol, xanthan gum, tetrasodium glutamate diacetate and of course, hemp extract CBD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, after a few uses of the JustCBD CBD infused pain cream, I also noticed my skin improving, which is another great advantage of using the pain relief cream.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also attempted making a CBD pain relief cream on my own using JustCBD&rsquo;s guide. It came out super easy and quite effective.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Review of the JustCBD Signature Vape Cartridge -Sour Diesel</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JustCBD signature vape cartridges are primarily made of CBD oil, vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, terpenes, and broad-spectrum hemp. From my experience with different CBD brands, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that JustCBD is the only brand that uses broad spectrum hemp oil, as mentioned in their ingredients. Similar to the other JustCBD products, the vape juices, too, are free from GMOs and pesticides.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary reason behind using broad spectrum hemp in their vape cartridges is the increased potency of the broad spectrum hemp. This drastically improves the effects of CBD and allows you to experience the effects of CBD for a more extended period. Although I&rsquo;m not a big fan of vaping, I had to try out the signature vape juices by JustCBD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although I only tried the Sour Diesel Signature Cartridge by JustCBD, there are other flavors as well, including the Northern Lights and Pineapple Express. Sour diesel being the most popular, I was keener towards trying this out, only after a few hits, two, to be precise. I felt the stress leaving my body and felt more relaxed and revitalized. This also led me to be more productive since I was free of my clogged mind. Coming to the actual flavor, as you can already tell by the name, it has a rubber-like smell, which I do not really like, but its calming effect kept me hooked.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the primary aim of JustCBD, &ldquo;Getting the most out of CBD and using it for our own benefit,&rdquo; I absolutely loved the product. Starting from coconut oil CBD tincture, it is by far my favorite means of using CBD. Moreover, it is also the easiest form of CBD intake, considering the fact that all you need to do is take a droplet or two right under your tongue and then sit back and let CBD do its wonders. Moreover, it is also versatile and can be used in different drinks and baked goods as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next on the list is JustCBD Ultra Relief Pain Cream, which worked flawlessly, to my surprise. It not only reduced my pain but since I used it a couple of times, it drastically improved my skin as well. A point to ponder is that CBD infused pain creams work their way through the different skin layers to ensure your pain is healed. What I specifically liked about using this CBD infused pain cream is that it is free from menthol. Although it is essential in the healing process, I am not a big fan of the cooling sensation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, JustCBD vape cartridges are a great means of making your mind unclogged from all of the thoughts and stress build-up. It can effectively lower your stress and allows you to be more focused and more productive. Thus, the people who are constantly stressed need to try the signature vape cartridges by JustCBD.</p>
